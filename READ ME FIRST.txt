NOTE: 

*Change the file path before running the code.

*Also change the backslash( \ ) with the forwardslash( / )
Example
	change this:
		dataset = pd.read_csv(filepath ="C:\Users\Bhavesh\Desktop\bitcoininputdata.csv")

	TO:
		dataset = pd.read_csv(filepath ="C:/Users/Bhavesh/Desktop/bitcoininputdata.csv")


*While Training we used the similar Dataset which gives 4 different output as HTML pages

*The libraries and modules used in the code you provided:

	1. numpy: A library for numerical operations in Python.
	2. pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library.
	3. matplotlib.pyplot: A library for creating plots and data visualization.
	4. sklearn.metrics: Part of the scikit-learn library for machine learning metrics.
	5. tensorflow.keras: The Keras deep learning library integrated with TensorFlow.
	6. keras.models: The Keras library for defining neural network models.
	7. keras.layers: Keras layers for constructing neural networks.
	8. plotly.offline: Plotly for creating interactive and offline charts.
	9. plotly.graph_objs: Plotly objects for creating chart components.
	10. sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler: Part of the scikit-learn library for scaling data.
	11. pandas.DataFrame: A data structure for handling tabular data.
	12. LSTM, Dense, GRU, and Dropout layers from Keras for building and training neural networks.

It's important to note that you'll need to install these libraries if you haven't already.
